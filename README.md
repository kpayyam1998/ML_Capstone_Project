# Tensorflow_Project
This project all about Cleaning the data,processing data and sentiment analysis using tensor flow.drop out function using tensor.
In this repo i have done many capstone project.load sample data ,data analysis,data clean,Making ML model with cleaned data,trained model, predicting data, AC score using jypyter notebook

# Porject Responsibility which i have shared below
**************************************************

* I have done load dataset

* I have done finding the missing data & I have checked null values present or not & did some more analysis like removed unwanted columns 

* I have done making proper dataset for ML models

* I have done trained model

* I have done predicing the data. 

* I have done few project using deep learning algorithm like (CNN face detection)
